# Introduction to Debugging

Kubernetes is "self-healing", we don't have to do anything in case something goes wrong. However, sometimes we might need to interfere, or find issues in our config.

Some preliminary tools to solve issues:

- `kubectl describe` - shows the details of a resource
- `kubectl logs` - shows the logs of possibly broken software
- `kubectl delete` - deletes a resource

When using describe, Events is often the section we want to look at.

If we want a nicer view of all this information, we can use Lens or Freelens, which are GUIs for Kubernetes.
